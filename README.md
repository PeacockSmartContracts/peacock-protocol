Peacock-Protocol is an LP token modeled off of SAFEMOON with extra functionality in mind.

Peacock-Protocol(PPTL) is a liquidity token smart contract built to HODL. We‚Äôre modeled off of the SAFEMOON smart contract, but Peacock-Protocol isn‚Äôt just another Safemoon clone. Peacock-Protocol currently lives on the BNB smart chain network for its low fees and growth potential, but can be paired with any crypto asset on other networks through our burn wallets. Find us on PancakeSwap for liquidity pairing.


What sets Peacock-Protocol apart from its parent SAFEMOON smart contract is it‚Äôs ability to be paired with other physical asset-backed stable coin crypto like HOMELINX and the upcoming (ENGEN). You can find Peacock protocol on PancakeSwap; We Love It There!üòÅ This provides an ease of use we‚Äôre all familiar with.

#Full specs on Peacock-protocol:

Total Supply 100,000,000,000

50% burned at mint

Peacock-Protocol is also built to pair with HOMELINX a physical-asset/stable-coin backed bep20 DEFI token and will launch together. With HOMELINX goal of adding 250,000 BUSD at launch in Peacock-Protocol. HOMELINX is only the first BUSD stablecoin pairing for Peacock-Protocol we hope to partner with more bep20 tokens in the future and have panned to do so.
